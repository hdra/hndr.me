                    </header>

                    <section class="post-content">
                        <p>I tried again and again to setup a Linux <span class="caps">OS</span> on my laptop, hoping to eventually making it my 
main operating system, but, again and again, I find it just not practical enough. There was 
always something that doesn&#8217;t work correctly. Things like programs that kept crashing, windows 
that suddenly froze, drivers not working, or simply, everything being sluggish. All that time, I 
always kept thinking that Linux on desktop is good enough to be used the same way I use Windows, 
or maybe, <span class="caps">OSX</span>. I was wrong. So, why am I doing this again this time? Well, for one thing, final
exams are coming, and I should be studying instead of messing with my computer, so yeah, that 
dreadful &#8216;P&#8217; word. But, other than that, I also want to try a different approach this&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The usual pitch with Linux on desktop is that they are no longer hard to use as they used to. 
They require less resources to run. They can be made whatever you want them to. Truth: the ones 
that are user friendly are nowhere near lightweight, and many of them aren&#8217;t even that configurable
by design, in the name of user friendliness. I do believe that overall, they are all moving to
the right direction. Especially the work Linux Mint team done with <a href="http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com">Cinnamon</a> has been very
exciting. Canonical has also been hard at work with Ubuntu, coming up with all kinds of stuff that
makes Linux more and more viable as a desktop <span class="caps">OS</span>. They even plan to develop <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/03/canonical-announce-custom-display-server-mir-not-wayland-not-x">their own display server</a>.
The trends are going towards an <span class="caps">OS</span> that is tightly integrated, better hardware support, and of 
course, easier to use. Customizability might be the only thing that are going away. I personally
don&#8217;t really care for it, as long as they work well enough for me, I wouldn&#8217;t really need to
configure much&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>Seems like easy enough for me to just pick a distribution and use it. Too bad, it is not that simple
for me. Here are some of my problem with the existing &#8216;mainstream linux&#8217;:
<em> I mentioned that the ability to configure the <span class="caps">OS</span> doesn&#8217;t matter that much to me, as long as it 
works well enough. Problem is, none of them are good enough, so my only option is to use one
that I can customize to suit my use.
</em> My laptop is almost 4 years old. It runs Windows 8 smoothly. It can even run some of the recent 
heavyweight games with no problem. But, surprisingly,  believe it or not, running vanilla Ubuntu
with Unity doesn&#8217;t come without noticeable lags. I believe the hardware drivers play quite a part
in this. Looking around, seems like most people seems pretty happy with the open source graphic card
driver, so I guess its time for me to upgrade, but, I am still saving up.
* Related to my first point, in my attempt trying to bend the <span class="caps">OS</span> to suit my taste, many things
became a tangled mess. This makes unexpected things to stop working during unexpected times. Since
many of the distribution tried to make things easy to use, many things became hidden away. This 
also makes it hard to reproduce the configuration because I am not even sure what I&nbsp;changed.</p>
<p>So, with all that in mind, I decided how I want this attempt on using Linux would be:
<em> Lightweight. A must. I don&#8217;t think I can use an <span class="caps">OS</span> that aren&#8217;t at least as fast as Windows.
</em> Customizable. I think I was looking for the wrong thing if I focus on ease of use when trying
out Linux out of the box. For now. This time, I would look for something that may requires some 
configuration overhead, but overall, would make everything easier to use.
<em> Works. Of course, By this I mean I don&#8217;t want having to install codecs to play music, or not 
audio jack not working, having to dig for drivers for wireless card, multi-monitor configuration, etc.
</em> Doesn&#8217;t hide things from me. I want to know what is going on in as many places as possible.
As little magic as possible. I want to be able to reproduce my configuration easily.
<em> Makes me more productive. The whole point of me thinking to switch to Linux is so that I can
do things, especially programming related things, faster, easier, and better. I want to take
full advantage of <span class="caps">UNIX</span>. I want to use as many keyboard shortcuts as possible. I don&#8217;t expect this
to be there out of the box, but I want it to be at least configurable to achieve this.
</em> Looks good. I don&#8217;t need shiny and fancy, but at the very least, I don&#8217;t want it to be unbearably&nbsp;ugly.</p>
<p>Of course, I can&#8217;t simply blame everything on the <span class="caps">OS</span>. There are also mistakes in the way I 
approached this in the past. I just expected everything to work without making an effort to know
what is happening behind the scene. So, this time, here is how I am going to do it.
<em> No configuration tool such as ubuntu-tweak and such. If there is a file that I need to edit,
I want to know what it is, and how to change it.
</em> Read the <code>man</code>. I always avoided having to read the help page of most tools, as I preferred to
just have the command to enter presented to me via the great wisdom of Google.
<em> Take it slow. No need to rush to make the <span class="caps">OS</span> for me to use. Making sure things work properly 
is the priority.
</em> Document everything. I want to know the steps I took to achieve something, and I want to make 
sure it can be easily reproduced. Maybe write a build script for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>All that covered, I have some plan in mind on how to do it. Lightweight, customizable, reasonably
low-level, stable, friendly. Next will be on setting it up. By the way, while I was writing this 
post, Linux Mint 15 &#8220;Olivia&#8221; was announced! and look at <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/rel_olivia_whatsnew.php">them</a>! So pretty! This can be
harder than I expected with that kind of&nbsp;temptation.</p>
