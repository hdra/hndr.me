        <article>
            <p>Starting from this month, I have been officially in my current job for 6 months, which also means I just got out of the probation period for the company. During the past 6 months, I have been doing a bunch of various things, and also learned a lot of stuffs that I have never really thought&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>Anyway, the main reason I am writing this post right now is simple: I am procrastinating. I have several conference videos that I wanted to watch, and also several libraries and frameworks that I want to try out, but for some reason, my mind keeps drifting away. This week, three developers I work with left the company, one of which is the person who mentored me during my internship with them. I have known about the departure a few weeks prior, and I didn&#8217;t actually thought about it much, but it turns out, the departure of these colleagues does affect me quite a bit. I thought I am used to changes, but it seems like I&#8217;m not. It made me think about stuffs. Stuffs that are hard to put in writing, stuffs that are uncomfortable to think&nbsp;about.</p>
<p>Anyway, most of my work now revolves around the back end, I had to learn a bunch of stuffs on server administration, distributed architecture, and I also ended up using the Laravel <span class="caps">PHP</span> framework a lot. Which is actually very fun and exciting, until something blows up and data are lost, that is. Anyway, all that stuffs that I learned during the period makes for a lot of materials that I wanted to write up, but for various reasons (mainly me being lazy), I never ended up getting to it. While using the static site generator is excellent in terms of simplicity, it also meant that I have to open up my text editor and generate a new site even just to post a short draft. I considered migrating my site to <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, but having to manage a server pushed me sticking with Pelican. What I do now is to write my drafts in Evernote, and then paste them here when it is ready, which isn&#8217;t exactly a seamless process considering Evernote&#8217;s lacking support for Markdown. That being said, I do hope it would help me to write&nbsp;more.</p>
