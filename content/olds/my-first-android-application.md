Title: My First Android Application

Ok, I think I mentioned that I (with a partner in my group) am
developing an Android application for a class assignment, and here it
is, its finished, but not a really usable apps though.

It’s a app to encrypt SMS before sending it. It uses an asymmetric
encryption algorithm, RSA, meaning that the key exchange needs to be
done before sending any encrypted message. The encryption and decryption
can only be done within the apps itself.

The development process aren’t very intuitive IMO, the emulator are just
plain unusable, and eclipse integration just didn’t feel ‘native’.
Switching between code view and design view takes several seconds to
load, but then, maybe that’s just my laptop. The main programming
language used is Java, so there isn’t too much problem there, but I am
not really used to the UI markup system, maybe I need more experience to
get into it. Still, the biggest problem is the emulator, honestly,
during the development process, whenever I did some change, I always
feel reluctant to test it, because everything is just so slow. I don’t
have any plan yet, but maybe I will look more into this sometime in the
future.

Well, as mentioned before, its not a really usable app, I don’t really
understand the RSA algorithm, and I don’t put any effort in making the
interface good looking either. But then, whatever,
