Ok, so I mentioned that I am developing several Windows Phone 7 Apps,
and I actually got one of them published on the marketplace! Most of the
others are still unpublished yet though, either its going on review, or
well, I just didn’t finish it.

So, here is the one that got it to the marketplace. Demotivator 7, it’s
a application to create demotivator posters from the pictures stored in
the phone. The download link is [here][store].

There are some bugs when creating a portrait poster, I already fixed
that, but I just don’t feel like updating it yet because of the
troublesome upload process, so, maybe later.
