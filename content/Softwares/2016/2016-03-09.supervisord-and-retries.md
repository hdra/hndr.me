Summary: Important note to remember when using supervisord with queues.
Category: Software


When you are deploying an application to production that includes a background queue,
it is important to also setup a process monitor to make sure the worker stays up.

One of the most popular process monitor is [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/), which also happens
to be the one included in the [Laravel guide on queues](https://laravel.com/docs/master/queues#supervisor-configuration) which
makes it pretty much the default process monitor on a Laravel deployment.

Many background queue libraries, including the one that came with Laravel
will automatically retry jobs that fails due to an exception. They usually also include
a way to control how many times the jobs should be retried before giving up and
moving it to the failed jobs store.

```
php artisan queue:listen connection-name --tries=3
```

One thing to keep in mind is that supervisord also includes a way to control the
[maximum number of attempts to start a process after serial crashes](http://supervisord.org/configuration.html).
When this limit is reached, it will stop trying to restart the process and the process will be put into
the `FATAL` state. This number is controlled via the configuration entry called `startretries`, and it defaults to `3`.

In most cases, one wouldn't need to change this setting. But, if you set the number of retries
on job queue to be larger than `3`, you need to make sure that the `startretries` is also
increased accordingly. If the `startretries` is set to a number that is less than the `tries` attempt,
it could cause an issue where *the supervisord retry limit is reached before the job retries
limit is reached*. When this happens, the process is put into a `FATAL` state, and the worker process
doesn't get started anymore, *halting the entire job queue*.

```
[program:laravel-worker]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php /home/forge/app.com/artisan queue:work sqs --sleep=3 --tries=5
autostart=true
autorestart=true
startretries=5
user=forge
numprocs=8
redirect_stderr=true
stdout_logfile=/home/forge/app.com/worker.log
```

So, remember, make sure to keep the queue worker tries equal to or smaller than the supervisord's `startretries`
to make sure the failing jobs get moved to the failed jobs queue before they halt the entire job queue.
Of course this won't help if the queue is full of jobs that keeps failing, but in that scenario, you
should really take a look at your queue worker code anyway.
