Continuing the last post, another thing i would like to note is the
generator expression in python. The function is almost the same as the
list comprehension, but instead of processing the whole data structures
at once, it performs the works one at a time. This would mean less
memory usage and performance when dealing with a massive amount of data.
To use it, just replace the square brackets on list comprehension with
parentheses.

    :::python
    evens = (for x in range(10000) if x%2==0)
    for x in evens:
        print evens

    # more example, this can apply to list comprehension as well
    # generate a tuple of possible combinations of odd and even number in the range
    permutation = ((x,y) for x in range(5) if x%2==0 for y in range(5,10) if y%2!=0)
