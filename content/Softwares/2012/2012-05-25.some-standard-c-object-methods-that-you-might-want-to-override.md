Title: Some Standard C# Object Methods That You Might Want to Override

Alright, I’ll get it straight to the point, since this is just a note to
myself anyway,

First one, the ToString() :

    :::csharp
    class YourClass{
        private string name;
        private int age;
        public override string ToString()
        {
            return "Name: "+this.name+",Age: "+this.age.toString();
        }
    }

The reason to this is, simple, to have an easy way to get a string
representation of your object. Of course, in a way, you can also create
a new method to return the same thing, but it is a good idea to do it
the “C# way”, and the ToString method is always there, so why create two
methods that serve the same purpose? This is similar to the
`__string__` method in Python.

The second one, Equals():

    :::csharp
    public class MyClass
    {
        private int x;
        private int y;

        public override bool Equals(object obj)
        {
            MyClass myclass = (MyClass)obj;
            if(myclass.x == this.x && myclass.y == this.y)
            {
                return true;
            }
            else
            {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

The reason to do this, is so to have an easy way to compare objects in
C#, as objects are stored as references, a ‘==’ comparison will always
return false, even if they have the same properties values, unless they
actually refer to the same object. The reason to override this method
instead of creating a new one, is the same as the reason to override the
ToString() method I mentioned above.
