As I recently reinstalled my Windows system, I had to re-install almost
every programs I usually use again, one of them is the Visual Studio, and
since I have been messing around with Phonegap these days, I had to set
it up again. I did what I did before, copying the project template zip
file to my templates folder, and I tried to create a new Phonegap
project, but when I try to build it, Visual Studio gives me an error
saying : “There is no script engine for file extension .js”.

This is pretty weird, since I set it up the same way last time, and it
works perfectly, so I did a bit of internet search, some other people
are having the same problem as well, and most of them suggested the fix
[here][link1]. I tried it, but it doesn’t work for me, further search leads me
to this [page][link2], and this is the solution that worked for me. I changed
the file association for .js files back to the Microsoft Window Based
Script host ( it was associated with notepad++ before), and I tried to
compile it again, and everything is good again.
