Ok, I have been working on updating one of my windows phone app,
[Swatch 7][link1]. I added a feature that allows user to save the color they
picked. I have write more on that on another post, maybe after the app
on the marketplace is updated. So, to remove one finished doing that,
but I’llof the saved color, I used the context menu provided with the
windows phone toolkit. It’s a bit different in the way that I can’t
access the selected item of the `ListBox` the ordinary way ( the
selectedIndex returns –1, so that means holding down a listbox item
doesn’t count as selecting it). So, I need a way to get information
about which item to remove, and after a bit of internet search, here is
how I do it:

    :::xml
    <ListBox Name="paletteList">
        <ListBox.ItemTemplate>
            <DataTemplate>
                <Grid Margin="4">
                    <toolkit:ContextMenuService.ContextMenu>
                        <toolkit:ContextMenu>
                            <toolkit:MenuItem Header="Delete" Name="removeFromPalette"
                                            Click="removeFromPalette_Click"/>
                        </toolkit:ContextMenu>
                    </toolkit:ContextMenuService.ContextMenu>
                </Grid>
            </DataTemplate>
        </ListBox.ItemTemplate>
    </ListBox>

Those are the code to set the context menu for the listbox, and here is
how the C# code on the click event:

    :::csharp
    private void removeFromPalette_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        Item selectedItem = (sender as MenuItem).DataContext as Item;
        // Do whatever with the selectedItem
    }
