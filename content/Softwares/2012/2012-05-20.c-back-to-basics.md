Title: C# Back to Basics

I have been programming C# for quite some time, but when I think about
it, I have never really tried to learn C# as a language, instead what
I’ve been playing with around are mostly the .NET framework itself, this
result in me having to guess the magic behind many of the operations in
the programs I wrote myself, and that sucks.

I think this is a problem that plagues many .NET developers, because the
.NET framework is so powerful, many people can get away not knowing how
it works, but that can causes a lot of problems when I try to read on
some more advanced stuff, and not being able to even guess how that
work. Not to mention that relying on magic that I don’t understand don’t
really make me feel satisfied in writing programs.

So, that’s why I decided to learn C# from the basics, and I will be
posting some of the stuff that I think I should remember here. I will be
using the [C# Yellow Book by Rob Miles][link1] for my reference, so a lot of
the posting that I will be doing may be similar to what’s in the book,
but I will be writing it in a way that I can easily understand myself.

Well, that’s all for now, hope I can pull it off.
