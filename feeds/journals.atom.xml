A day in the new year is a good time as any to take a pause and look back to see how the year has been, and I think as far as a verdict goes, I can only say the year 2017 has been a mixed bag for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I accomplished many things that I&amp;#8217;m quite proud of at work this year, yet I would be hard pressed to say that it has been a great year. Just shows how much can happen in such a short time in the startup&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üëç I started my current job around May 2016, and with that, 2017 has been the first year in which I worked entirely as a full-time remote employee. Looking back, the year started off pretty&amp;nbsp;great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üòÄ More productivity! I have gotten much better at managing my time and focusing at the tasks at hand. I learned to not let Slack and email notifications to be that much of a disruption as they used to be in the beginning. My family members also finally got used to the idea of &amp;#8220;working from home&amp;#8221;, which also helps in this&amp;nbsp;aspect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üòÄ Been part of a great team. We were able work with some new technologies to ship a critical-piece of software and see it get used on the&amp;nbsp;ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚òπÔ∏è A restructuring in the company has resulted in my team getting cut. Plans to expand the team further had to be reversed, and projects had to be scrapped. Lost a number of key team members and the team pretty much ended up with a bus factor of 1&amp;nbsp;(me).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üò∞ I ended up being stressed out most of the time. Too many pucks ending at me made me feel restless. The uncertainties around the company direction also made it difficult to prioritise the work to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üòê We still managed to ship a number of new features and keep improving the software, and we are somewhat still cruising along with some improvement in the metrics, but morale has low for quite a&amp;nbsp;while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The year 2017 at work started out amazing, though halfway through the year the situation changed quite drastically. The uncertainty is still continuing to the new year, and its time I look back and see what steps to take&amp;nbsp;next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Growth&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üòÄ Learned functional programming with &lt;a href="https://elixir-lang.org/"&gt;Elixir&lt;/a&gt; and was able to ship a software to production with it! Too many things learned from this experience to list down here. I&amp;#8217;m hoping to finish a number of drafts on this topic this year. For now, suffice to say that learning the immutable functional programming paradigm of the language and the concurrency model of the Erlang &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VM&lt;/span&gt; has been one of the most valuable thing I learned as a programmer, which would keep paying dividends even when I&amp;#8217;m working with an imperative or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üìñ Bought a Kindle Paperwhite in late 2016, and it has been the best investment in a gadget I made. I was able to finish 30+ books in 2017. I used to read mostly non-fiction books, as I felt like I needed to &amp;#8220;gain&amp;#8221; something from reading a book. I think the Kindle helped me learn to read just for the sake of the pleasure of reading, because it made it so effortless to start reading. Most of the books I read this year are fiction, mostly mysteries, my vice, but I also managed to read literatures like &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4929.Kafka_on_the_Shore"&gt;Kafka on The Shore&lt;/a&gt; which turned out to be much more interesting that I&amp;nbsp;expected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üí° Got into a new hobby of tinkering with electronics that started with a random Raspberry Pi purchase. Started out with a simple programmable lamp outlet, but soon started spending a lot more money on this new hobby than I expected, so need to dial it back a little. But it has been fun. I already got a number of projects in mind that I would like to play with, and I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to learn more about electronics in this new&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stopped using Facebook and Instagram, and learned to use the mute filter on Twitter. Pulled myself out of a number &amp;#8220;online communities&amp;#8221;. Much better for my mental&amp;nbsp;health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Health&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üëç Managed to exercise quite constantly. I was able to wake up early and go for a morning run 3 days a week most of the year. There were weeks that I skipped because of travel or weather or other reasons, but there were also a number of weeks where I managed to put in 4-5 runs in a week. So I&amp;#8217;ll mark this a&amp;nbsp;yay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üëé Didn&amp;#8217;t eat all that well. Many unhealty meals and snacks (Really though, Indonesian food are soo hard to resist!). Ended up not losing as much weight as I would like&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;üò∞ Started getting pain in my wrists. I&amp;#8217;m not sure if it is because of the mechanical keyboard that I got or if it is because of the long periods of reading on the Kindle (I tend to hold it by resting it on my thumb). I ended up switching back to my old low-profile bluetooth keyboard, and got a &lt;a href="http://www.iring.com/"&gt;holder&lt;/a&gt; to help me grab on the Kindle. Not sure which of the two helped, but the pain seems to have subsided for now. I hope it won&amp;#8217;t be back&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;End&amp;nbsp;Notes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation at work has a way of affecting other aspects of one&amp;#8217;s life, and I&amp;#8217;m not any better in keeping them contained than most. Ended up with a number of side projects and blog posts drafts I didn&amp;#8217;t manage to finish. This kinda left a rather unsatisfying end to the year, but nevertheless,  I&amp;#8217;m aiming to finish soon in&amp;nbsp;2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, its never too late to do anything worth doing. There are many things to look forward to in 2018. Been learning and reading on data science and machine learning, been considering joining a gym to improve my health, and who knows what else would come up or what they will lead&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;

frameworks, libraries, and so on, all of which are supposed to help you write software better and faster.
For someone who is starting to learn programming, all these noise can be very confusing. Even for an experienced
programmer, all these stuff can be very distracting as well. The much discussed Javascript fatigue is a symptom
of the problem.  Unfortunately, I&amp;#8217;m not here to offer an anwer on how to deal with all that. I simply
would like to point out some of the things that you should be aware of while wading through all these&amp;nbsp;noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of this post is inspired by this talk by Ross Tuck below, which you should definitely check out.
He talked about a lot of the things that I have been thinking, and he was able to present those ideas more
eloquently than I&amp;nbsp;could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTi8jw86-_s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here is the thing; no one really knows what is the &amp;#8220;best&amp;#8221; tools or framework out there is. Like most things
in software engineering, the answer to such question is, and has always been &amp;#8220;it depends&amp;#8221;. The best tools for the
job depends on what the problem you need to solve, the constraints you face, what you already know, and so on, and
any claims of &amp;#8220;The One True Way&amp;#8221; should be faced with a generous amount of&amp;nbsp;scepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For better or worse, the startup booms that has been going on in the past few years has made the field of software very lucrative,
and there are money to be made in selling the tools that supports the making of software. One side effect of that is,
like what Ross said in his talk, developers are becoming more of both the target and the &lt;strong&gt;source&lt;/strong&gt; of marketing.
The problem is, many developers (myself included) like to think of themselves as being immune to marketing, and that
all their decisions are made based on objective evaluations of strengths and weaknesses of the available options.
&amp;#8220;Meritocracy&amp;#8221; definitely ranks pretty high up there among programmers&amp;#8217; favorite&amp;nbsp;words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many factors that come into consideration when you&amp;#8217;re trying to make a decision on which tools/framework
to use for a project. What you already know, what are the requirements of the project, and of course, the popularity
of the tool. That last one is becoming more and more of a deciding factor nowadays, which may sounds a little weird.
Shouldn&amp;#8217;t a tool be picked for what it is able to provide? Why does it matter how popular it is? The fact is, the popularity of a tool does matter. More popular tools would have more libraries written around it,
and there will also be more resources that can help you learn&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes a software popular though? And what does it mean for a software tool to be&amp;nbsp;popular?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not necessarily by being the &amp;#8220;best&amp;#8221;. Not necessarily by being the choice of many software developers to build
their projects with. It is because there are people who want them to be popular, and they put the effort to make
them so. So, yes, marketing. Not that marketing is bad thing, just that this means that just because
something is popular, doesn&amp;#8217;t mean it is also&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a software reach a certain level of popularity, much of the marketing for the tool comes from the users (the programmers)
themselves. Most are doing this because they have benefitted from the tool and would like to
promote the software because they truly believe these tools would help other people write better software faster
and easier. Some though, may simply jumped on the bandwagon because it can be profitable. Being positioned
as an expert on a popular software tool can be lucrative. From speaking engagement, workshops opportunity,
knowledge product sales, or job offers are some of the things that can come from such position. Which is one of the
driver of the hypes surrounding software&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how does one wade through all these hype-driven software development resources? Unfortunately, I don&amp;#8217;t have
an answer. I am still trying to figure it out myself. But that is something that you need to keep in mind
while consuming all these abundance of learning resources. If someone often speaks of a software tool
in absolute term, being overly critical of any criticism of the tool, or dismissing the value of learning
and taking ideas from alternative tools, you should assume that person may have objectives other than
sharing knowldge and promote good software engineering&amp;nbsp;ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn the basics, and know your tools well. Try not to get distracted by all the hype-noise because that is
all there is; noise.  All that noise aren&amp;#8217;t necessarily the gospel of the software development that you must learn.
People often have their own incentives for driving up the hype, and you won&amp;#8217;t be missing out on anything
important by ignoring&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="programming"></category><category term="learning"></category><category term="rant"></category></entry><entry><title>Random¬†Updates</title><link href="https://hndr.me/blog/random-updates" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-06-01T20:44:00+08:00</published><updated>2014-06-01T20:44:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2014-06-01:/blog/random-updates</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Starting from this month, I have been officially in my current job for 6 months ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Starting from this month, I have been officially in my current job for 6 months, which also means I just got out of the probation period for the company. During the past 6 months, I have been doing a bunch of various things, and also learned a lot of stuffs that I have never really thought&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the main reason I am writing this post right now is simple: I am procrastinating. I have several conference videos that I wanted to watch, and also several libraries and frameworks that I want to try out, but for some reason, my mind keeps drifting away. This week, three developers I work with left the company, one of which is the person who mentored me during my internship with them. I have known about the departure a few weeks prior, and I didn&amp;#8217;t actually thought about it much, but it turns out, the departure of these colleagues does affect me quite a bit. I thought I am used to changes, but it seems like I&amp;#8217;m not. It made me think about stuffs. Stuffs that are hard to put in writing, stuffs that are uncomfortable to think&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, most of my work now revolves around the back end, I had to learn a bunch of stuffs on server administration, distributed architecture, and I also ended up using the Laravel &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; framework a lot. Which is actually very fun and exciting, until something blows up and data are lost, that is. Anyway, all that stuffs that I learned during the period makes for a lot of materials that I wanted to write up, but for various reasons (mainly me being lazy), I never ended up getting to it. While using the static site generator is excellent in terms of simplicity, it also meant that I have to open up my text editor and generate a new site even just to post a short draft. I considered migrating my site to &lt;a href="https://ghost.org/"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;, but having to manage a server pushed me sticking with Pelican. What I do now is to write my drafts in Evernote, and then paste them here when it is ready, which isn&amp;#8217;t exactly a seamless process considering Evernote&amp;#8217;s lacking support for Markdown. That being said, I do hope it would help me to write&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>2014 -¬†Thoughts</title><link href="https://hndr.me/blog/2014-thoughts" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-01-29T14:33:00+08:00</published><updated>2014-01-29T14:33:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2014-01-29:/blog/2014-thoughts</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s rather late for a new year posting, considering we are almost entering the ‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s rather late for a new year posting, considering we are almost entering the second month 2014 by now, but well, what can I say, I haven&amp;#8217;t got much time to write the past few months, and now I am only writing because I&amp;#8217;m stuck waiting for the next ferry back to my hometown that isn&amp;#8217;t coming for 2&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 is pretty special for myself. New years are usually a chance to start something for most people, a fresh start, where any unpleasant things that has happened happened &amp;#8220;last year&amp;#8221;. That said, for most people, these words are simply figurative speech. While the calendar has indeed changed, most people&amp;#8217;s live didn&amp;#8217;t, and life still goes on as usual. I myself have never really celebrated new year as anything other than a chance to get together with friends and do some catching&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2014 is different. Quite a lot has changed in my life in the past few months. I recently graduated from university, with that, I also started a new job as a software&amp;nbsp;engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s pretty much it. And wow, it&amp;#8217;s sounds pretty trivial now that I think about it. But still, a new year usually calls us to reflect about past events. I have been thinking about what kind of person I&amp;#8217;ve been, what kind of person I want to be, what I want to do in my life, pretty much my life direction in&amp;nbsp;general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back about myself, there are many things that I wish I&amp;#8217;d done differently. Especially during my university years. I was too much of a coward to take more risk in pretty much everything. People who I didn&amp;#8217;t take the chance to know more about, trips to places I didn&amp;#8217;t travel to, skills I didn&amp;#8217;t spend more time learning, and many others. I wasted too much time doing things that I didn&amp;#8217;t really care about just because they are things I&amp;#8217;m comfortable&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the risk of sounding like a humblebrag, but I was one of those guys who didn&amp;#8217;t study much, yet still managed to get high scores in class. I honestly didn&amp;#8217;t find the works for my bachelor degree to be too difficult, and I find as long as I pay attention during classes, the only time I would need to study outside of classes would be a day or two before an exam. Because of this I ended up with a lot of free time. But I stupidly spent all these free time doing things like watching movies, surfing the web aimlessly, and other time wasting activities in general. I regretted not using those free times that I had to socialize more, join a student organization or two, learn how to play one or two instruments, and so on. I used to see my friends who seemed to barely have any free time and think what is it about this cozy university life that takes up so much of his time. Well, the answer is simply he made the most of his time in university. I used to think that university life is way too easy and boring. Well, how can it be not easy and boring, I did it&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I am no longer a student, I am consciously trying to be more active and socialize more. It&amp;#8217;s not easy though, I am your average geek and an through and though introvert, and meeting new people isn&amp;#8217;t my forte, but I am trying, and hopefully this will help me find what I want to do in&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I would like to change is my health. I have been obese as far as I can remember, and now that I have a full time job as a programmer, I can&amp;#8217;t think of any reason that would somehow magically change. I need to start taking responsibility of my health, and not make excuses for me failing to lose weight. I am going to buy a bicycle when I get back from my leave (yes, typical. Always start someday in the future. Seriously though, I&amp;#8217;ll stick to this plan), and I&amp;#8217;ll start commuting to work with my bike. Hopefully this would push me to exercise&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In work, while I do love what I do, and the work environment is awesome, it&amp;#8217;s not all rainbow and unicorns either. In my first project, I had to work with an existing system that well, let&amp;#8217;s just say it&amp;#8217;s difficult to work with. I myself also committed a big mistake in another project, I chosen a technology stack that no one else seemed to be interested in learning. I personally do love and believe in this stack (and I do think that the way we have been programming needs some serious improvement), which is why I chose it, but I came to learn that in a collaboration project I need to consider more than just the technical merit. I need to consider the people I&amp;#8217;ll be working with, and how comfortable they are in learning these things. The project ended up behind schedule, mostly because other in my team aren&amp;#8217;t comfortable with the new (not that new though) technology yet, and me being too much of an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCD&lt;/span&gt;, spent way too much time than I should have cleaning up codes that other people just wrote. Lesson learned. Shipping should comes first before technical aesthetic. Save the beautiful code (not that I am really capable of writing code that good anyway :P) for personal&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, when I was applying for jobs several months ago, I had several offers that comes with higher salary than the one that I accepted (my current job). The reason I took on this job is because I felt that I can learn the most about tech with this environment, and since this is my first job anyway, I didn&amp;#8217;t really think of looking for a position with the highest salary so that I can stay for years earning more money. The opportunity to learn. That was what I thought I should be looking for in my first job. But now, I am worried that I maybe forming a bubble around myself to get comfortable and not challenging myself. So that&amp;#8217;s another thing that I should work&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In life, well, I am still looking for what I want to do in life, but well, for starter, I would love to be able to travel more, get to know more people, hopefully I am able to find people dear to me. While I am an introvert, I do have several close friends that I value very much, but to be honest, the people that really matters to me are my family. For some reason I feel like it&amp;#8217;s not supposed to be this way, and I should have more people that I care about. I don&amp;#8217;t know, I guess this is just one of those things that I would know when the time&amp;nbsp;comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On traveling, well, I have been wanting to travel for several years, but for the past few years, as a poor student living on a scholarship, it&amp;#8217;s not really financially feasible. Not to mention the traveling cost, event the some of visa application fee would&amp;#8217;ve cost me a month&amp;#8217;s living cost. Now that I am working and earning a salary, I hope to be able to save up some money and travel somewhere. Even though visiting the old European cities have been on my mind for quite a while now, I don&amp;#8217;t really have a place that I want to visit yet. It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter where, I am still looking for a place that would pull me&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the life goal, well, I thought about it a lot, but I still can&amp;#8217;t find an answer that I am satisfied with. I guess this is just one those things that you can&amp;#8217;t rush. Well, there is no need to rush it anyway. Some people spend their whole life looking for a destination without finding one, maybe there isn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;#8217;s goes for my 2014 reflection. I don&amp;#8217;t really want to make another new year&amp;#8217;s resolution as my 2012 and 2013 resolution aren&amp;#8217;t completely crossed out yet, so here is my 2014 &amp;#8220;goal&amp;nbsp;guidelines&amp;#8221;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise more, start commuting to work with the bike, lose at least&amp;nbsp;15KGs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be more active, socialize more, don&amp;#8217;t get trapped in the comfort&amp;nbsp;zone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start a new project, stick to it, and make it something that&amp;nbsp;counts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop taking life so seriously. It&amp;#8217;s just&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s it, I guess. Ah, of course, I didn&amp;#8217;t really include any geek topic so far, so I guess I should mention some. Well, I plan to do another re-design for this site, make new Pelican theme. Let&amp;#8217;s see how that goes. I also plan to rewrite the &lt;a href="https://github.com/hdra/WP_Mog"&gt;Mog WordPress theme&lt;/a&gt;, clean up the codes, and maybe build it on top of one of the popular &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; framework so that it&amp;#8217;s more&amp;nbsp;maintainable.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>New Stage in¬†Life</title><link href="https://hndr.me/blog/new-stage-in-life" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-11-16T19:47:00+08:00</published><updated>2013-11-16T19:47:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-11-16:/blog/new-stage-in-life</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a while since I posted anything.

The last time I posted something was in August, so it has been around two months. Since then, many things have&amp;nbsp;changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had my last day in college on July. I had my convocation ceremony on October, so yep. I am officially holding a B.Sc. degree. It was pretty exciting. Also, now I am working as a Software Engineer! I am now officially a professional programmer. I write code for a living. I also just moved to a new place today, so things has been very hectic in the past few months. From the job search, tying things up with my scholarship, looking for a place to rent, starting a new job, all these things has been taking up most of my&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last project I worked on was the WordPress theme that I uploaded on &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/mog/"&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;, and thankfully the support email has slowed down ever since the theme was moved from the featured themes. I haven&amp;#8217;t even been spending my free time coding that much. Lack of proper workspace and my dying laptop are what I would blame, but I guess I was kind of tired with all the changes that are happening as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am rather excited this new stage of life, and I hope I can learn more from my job and the people around&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>When Noise Gets Too¬†Much</title><link href="https://hndr.me/blog/when-noise-gets-too-much" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-07-11T23:15:00+08:00</published><updated>2013-07-11T23:15:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2013-07-11:/blog/when-noise-gets-too-much</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The World Wide Web is an amazing thing.

You can learn just about anything you can think of with these resources. Recently though, I noticed that amount of low quality content is getting way a lot&amp;nbsp;higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until a few months ago, I collected almost everything I can get my hands on. I bookmarked every programming article I found that looked interesting, even though I barely know anything about the topic. When major tech conferences like Microsoft&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.buildwindows.com"&gt;Build&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/io/‚Äé"&gt;Google I/O&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://www.pycon.org"&gt;Pycon&lt;/a&gt; were held, I scanned the videos for titles that looked interesting and downloaded a bunch of them. I saved a bunch of videos from channels like Marakana or Google Tech Talks. I downloaded every single free programming books that people that people on sites like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HN&lt;/span&gt; or reddit, even though I don&amp;#8217;t know what the book talk about that much. As you may have guessed, only a very small portion of those bookmarks ever get visited for the second time, I barely watched any of the videos I downloaded, and most of the ebooks I downloaded never even got extracted from the zip&amp;nbsp;archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until Google announced the plan to shutdown Google Reader, I subscribed to a bunch of tech blogs, blogs like Techcrunch, or Gizmodo. Every morning, I would have 700+ new items on the reader, and I would scanned through all of them, click on what I find interesting, and mark everything else as read. It lasted for several months, but not only it was tedious, I started to realize many of their article are low-quality link-bait, not fact-based articles that fishes for stupid fan-boy arguments. I don&amp;#8217;t want to link to them for examples, but I am sure they aren&amp;#8217;t hard to&amp;nbsp;find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when Google Reader was shut down, I moved to &lt;a href="http://feedly.com"&gt;feedly&lt;/a&gt;, and I took the chance to clean up my feeds. I use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; only to keep updated with some blogs of people whose writing I find interesting. Most of the are only updated occasionally, and I find myself reading almost every single one of them. The only tech blogs I follow are few that I find still publish actual professional news and pieces I enjoy reading, like &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/"&gt;The Verge&lt;/a&gt;. I keep up with their updates selectively through channels like Twitter and/ or Facebook instead of trying to keep up with everything they&amp;nbsp;published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same case with the stuffs I kept on my hard drive. I deleted every videos and books that I find not too relevant because of the technology changes, or those that I found not too interesting after I went through them&amp;nbsp;briefly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt great. I feel much more relaxed. During the time I was living with these noises, I felt obligated to read or watch them. Now, not so much. Nowadays, I get my fix from channels such as Twitter, some highly-curated mailing-lists, also the top news on sites like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HN&lt;/span&gt; and Reddit. I also keep my reading list with Pocket, and keep track of my projects with Trello. It feels good not having to manage them myself (Yes, I know that these cloud services could be shut down any time, but I really hope they won&amp;#8217;t for anytime&amp;nbsp;soon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out, there is a downside to the abundance of information these&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit:&lt;/em&gt; Changed on my opinion on the news&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>I Bought a Xperia¬†Sola</title><link href="https://hndr.me/blog/i-bought-a-xperia-sola" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-12T17:40:00+08:00</published><updated>2012-07-12T17:40:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2012-07-12:/blog/i-bought-a-xperia-sola</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I bought a new&amp;nbsp;phone.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Xperia Sola" src="http://api.sonymobile.com/files/xperia-sola-black-464x515.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few days ago, I bought a new phone, &lt;a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/global-en/products/phones/xperia-sola/"&gt;Sony Xperia Sola&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, its an
Android phone. The Lumia phones are simply fucked up, no upgrade path to
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP8&lt;/span&gt;, and the price that for some reason aren‚Äôt going down, I simply
can‚Äôt objectively spend my money on it. In addition, without even any
news of when the new Windows Phone 8 are coming out and their price, I
don‚Äôt think I can wait. This doesn‚Äôt mean that I will stop developing
for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;, I might buy one for development purpose if they offer a solid
phone at a reasonable price when &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP8&lt;/span&gt; comes out, but then again, without
any news on the new development platform either, it doesn‚Äôt mean I will
continue developing for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, enough about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WP&lt;/span&gt;, lets talk about the new phone instead. The reason
for me choosing this phone is of course, the price-value ratio. It has a
dual-core &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; card slot, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFC&lt;/span&gt;, and even a promise of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICS&lt;/span&gt; upgrade by
Sony. I also considered other options such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTC&lt;/span&gt; One V and Samsung
Galaxy S Advance, but after pondering about all kinds of stuff, I
decided that the Xperia Sola is the best option after all. Now I can
play with Android without dealing with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PITA&lt;/span&gt; emulator that is
included with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SDK&lt;/span&gt;. The screen is pretty bright and clear, and the
loudspeaker are also pretty loud. It also came with 4 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NFC&lt;/span&gt; tags that I
can play&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Android is pretty fun. Most of the essential apps out there are
available for Android, and I can almost do most things that I do on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt;
with my phone. I installed several reading apps, such as &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aldiko.android&amp;amp;feature=search_result"&gt;Aldiko&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=flipboard.app&amp;amp;feature=search_result"&gt;Flipboard&lt;/a&gt;, and several others. The email client is also pretty
awesome. Other than that, I still need to get used to the on-screen
keyboard, but I think it will be manageable. Although it seems like the
power of Android is also its weak points, in less than a day of using
the phone, I had several apps crash and freezes for no reason, only
cause I can think of is because the many process it is running at once,
which also causes the battery life to be quite&amp;nbsp;short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that‚Äôs all for now, I am looking forward to discovering more of
this&amp;nbsp;phone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="android"></category><category term="phone"></category><category term="xperia sola"></category></entry><entry><title>End of¬†Internship</title><link href="https://hndr.me/blog/end-of-internship" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-07T16:35:00+08:00</published><updated>2012-07-07T16:35:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Hendra</name></author><id>tag:hndr.me,2012-07-07:/blog/end-of-internship</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the last day of my internship at Terato Tech, 20 weeks has

passed by so quickly. I had a lot of fun, learned a lot of new stuffs,
and last but not least, met a lot of interesting&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to leave the project I was working on, and that is a little bit
sad, but I hope I can at least tie up some of the loose ends before I
stop working on it to move on the next project. There are many things
that I wished I had done better, I wish that I actually write a proper
framework for¬† the game instead of just writing a bunch of messy codes,
but I hope the code that I wrote won‚Äôt cause too much&amp;nbsp;trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, well, all in all, I enjoyed my internship very much, and I am very
grateful for the company for having me. Thank you&amp;nbsp;Terato.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have to go back to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTM&lt;/span&gt; to wait for my visa to be ready before I

system file, so do it on your own risk. Alright, so one thing that I do to avoid wasting too much time on a
&lt;a href="http://www.9gag.com"&gt;just-for-fun&lt;/a&gt; site, is to completely block it on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;. Of course, I
can still easily unblock it, but since I am very lazy, most of the time
I simply won‚Äôt bother doing&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, the way I do this is by editing the host file on my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;, and point
the domain name of the website that I wanted to stop visiting to the
localhost, which unless I am running a web server at the time, will
simply point to&amp;nbsp;nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Windows, the hosts file is located at
&lt;code&gt;C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts&lt;/code&gt;. Open up that file, and you should
see some description of the file, and an example of the host entry for
the localhost, which points to 127.0.0.1. The format for the host file
is like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;Destination to route to&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Url that you want toroute&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, for example, in my hosts file, I have this&amp;nbsp;line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;127.0.0.1 www.9gag.com
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, whenever I enter &lt;code&gt;www.9gag.com&lt;/code&gt;
to my browser, I would get routed to my localhost. Simple&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Linux, the steps are the same, the hosts file is located at
&lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt;. The format are the same as it is on&amp;nbsp;Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that to edit these files, you need to have administrator or root
access on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don‚Äôt want to edit individual hosts file on every computer you
own, an alternative is to use a service such as &lt;code&gt;OpenDNS&lt;/code&gt;_. You can
register for an account, customize the filtering, and simply configure
the internet access on your computer to use the service. That‚Äôs all for&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="hosts"></category></entry></feed>
